      It seems like everyone I have ever met has “a spaghetti recipe” they know
      and love, and each one is different! Some have store-bought sauce, some
      homemade. Some have meat, some have veggies, and others don’t.

      There's nothing like classic spaghetti and meat sauce to bring people
