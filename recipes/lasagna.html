      This is one recipe my husband begs me to make. He is obsessed with this
      lasagna and if he is stressed or overwhelmed with work, this is what I
      make him. It is the perfect comfort food meal! There's something so
      amazing about homemade, made-from-scratch lasagna. Whenever he orders beef
      lasagna at a restaurant, he ends up disappointed. This is such a warm,
      comforting dinner and can feed a crowd (or at least a lot of hungry kids).

      This is a classic homemade lasagna recipe made with layers of gooey melted
      mozzarella cheese, a parmesan ricotta cheese, and a robust tomato meat
      sauce. It is perfect for weeknight dinners, potlucks, or to take to
      friends who just had a baby. This lasagna recipe can be frozen so it is
      perfect to made ahead of time. It also makes flavorful leftovers.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Meat:</strong> This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian
        sausage and lean ground beef.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Onion and Garlic:</strong> An onion and two cloves of garlic are
        cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Tomato Products:</strong> You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes,
        two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sugar:</strong> Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle
        sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Spices and Seasonings:</strong> This lasagna recipe is flavored
        with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel
        seeds, and black pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Lasagna Noodles:</strong> Use store-bought or homemade lasagna
        noodles.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cheeses:</strong> Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make
        this lasagna extra decadent.
